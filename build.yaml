# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]
# include:
#   - board: bdn9_rev2
#   - board: nice_nano_v2
#     shield: reviung41
#   - board: nice_nano_v2
#     shield: corne_left

  # Alternative PINs firmware
  # This builds an additional firmware for the right half that overrides the
  # pins configured in `corne_tp_right.overlay` and creates a firmware that
  # uses the high frequency pins D1 for SCL and D2 for SDA.

  # You can remove this entry in your own zmk-config.

  # Settings Reset firmware
  # This will build a firmware that can wipe all settings from your
  # controller. It's useful when you have bluetooth issues or when your split
  # keyboard halfs are not pairing.
